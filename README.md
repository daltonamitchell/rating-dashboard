## Rating Dashboard

I built this app to see what I could do with the [Django framework](http://www.djangoproject.com). The basic premise is a application that let's you sort submissions based on weighted criteria that you define.

A live version can be found [here](https://dm-python-rating-dashboard.herokuapp.com/).

## How do I run this

To run this example you'll need to have [Python 3](http://www.python.org) installed. Then simply follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into the base directory.

2. Run `pip install requirements.txt`

3. and then `python dashboard/manage.py runserver`.

4. Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000` and enjoy!
